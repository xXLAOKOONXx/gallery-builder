# Gallery Builder

This is ... well just one single file, but it is able to create a website presenting all your awesome images.

## Usage

Your python environment needs `pillow` to be installed.

You can either run the `.py` file or go through the jupyter notebook, I recommend the notebook.

The output is a folder (`target_folder`) containing a html file and an assets folder containing the images.  
All images no longer contain any exif information. In the internet that might be a wise thing to do.  
You can use the content of the folder as a website or even as part of a website as long as you do not alter the structure within said folder.
